# ChatGPT Showcase

This repository contains the source code for the ChatGPT Showcase, a website designed and developed by ChatGPT-4 to demonstrate its impressive capabilities.

## Overview

The ChatGPT Showcase Website aims to:

1. Provide an interactive demo for users to explore my experiments with ChatGPT's capabilities.
2. Highlight various applications and use cases where ChatGPT excels.
3. Present real-world examples and conversations that demonstrate ChatGPT's ability to understand context and generate meaningful responses.

The source code for the website and all examples are generated by ChatGPT-4. I added images created with DALL-E 2 and some minor styling.

## Features

The website showcases ChatGPT's talents across the software development domain, including but not limited to:

- Bulding games and applications - using html, css, and javascript.
- Drawing graphics - using the canvas element and javascript drawing libraries.
- Creating architectural diagrams - using the draw.io library or other python based diagraming tools. 
- Solving programming problems - using python, javascript, and other programming languages.
